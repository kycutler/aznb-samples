    "# An informal introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a popular programming language that is reliable, flexible, easy to learn, free to use on all operating systems, and supported by both a strong developer community and many free libraries. Python supports all manners of development, including web applications, web services, desktop apps, scripting, data science, scientific computing, and Jupyter notebooks. Python is a language used by many universities, scientists, casual developers, and professional developers alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn more about the language on [python.org](https://www.python.org/) and [Python for Beginners](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This walkthrough is a Jupyter notebook version of the [python.org introductory tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/introduction.html), with some edits and amendments. Because all the code is inside code cells, you can just run each code cell inline rather than using a separate Python interactive window.\n",
    "\n",
    "This introduction is written for Python 3.6.7 but is generally applicable to other Python 3.x versions. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> **Note**: This notebook is designed to have you run code cells one by one, and several code cells contain deliberate errors for demonstration purposes. As a result, if you use the **Cell** > **Run All** command, some code cells past the error won't be run. To resume running the code in each case, use **Cell** > **Run All Below** from the cell after the error."

    "## Comments\n",

    "Many of the examples in this notebook include comments. Comments in Python start with the hash character, `#`, and extend to the end of the physical line. A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character. Since comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when typing in examples.\n",
